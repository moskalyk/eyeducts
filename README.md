# localducts ðŸ’§
probably a year ago i had the idea to create a networked tearduct app, so you can log or share when your eyes have tears. never got around to it. 

more recently i was eating a shawarma, and cut my (left) eye with the tinfoil. it's been tearing for a full day.

localducts is an expierment to log the health of my eye during recovery, and could be useful for others in the world during: violent times and / or to appreciate world mental health day (today)

# user story
as a user I want to select an eye and input a measurement percentage of the amount of tears that are in your eye all within 7 seconds (to align with evm mainnet blocktimes) all stored localstorage so that I can track trends of eyeduct moisture
